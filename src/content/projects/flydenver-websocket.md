**Introducing a High-Performance WebSocket Broadcast System**

I am excited to share this project that showcases the power of scalable, cost-effective web technologies. I developed a websocket broadcast system capable of broadcasting to 100,000 concurrent connections simultaneously. This project leverages various AWS services to ensure scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency. Currently, this system is live on flydenver.com, the official website of Denver International Airport.

**Project Overview**

The websocket broadcast system was designed to handle high traffic efficiently while keeping costs low. This solution is ideal for applications that require real-time updates to a large number of users, such as airport information systems, live event broadcasting, and more.

**Tech Stack and Development**

- **WebSocket Server:** Developed using AWS Lambda to handle serverless execution, ensuring that the system scales automatically based on demand.
- **Database:** AWS DynamoDB is used for its high availability and low latency, suitable for handling large volumes of data with ease.
- **Message Broadcasting:** AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) facilitates the efficient distribution of messages to all connected clients.
- **Additional AWS Services:** Integrated various other AWS services to optimize performance and ensure reliability.
- **Load Testing:** Utilized Locust, a powerful load testing tool, to validate the system's performance under heavy loads.

**Key Features**

- **Scalability:** Automatically scales to handle 100,000 concurrent connections without compromising performance.
- **Cost-Efficiency:** Designed to minimize costs by leveraging AWSâ€™s serverless architecture and pay-as-you-go pricing model.
- **Reliability:** Ensures consistent and reliable message delivery, critical for real-time applications.
- **Performance Testing:** Successfully load tested using Locust, confirming its ability to handle high traffic scenarios.

**Challenges and Solutions**

Building a system that could handle such a large number of concurrent connections posed several challenges, particularly in ensuring low latency and high reliability. By leveraging AWS Lambda for serverless execution and AWS DynamoDB for its robust database capabilities, I was able to create a system that not only meets but exceeds these requirements.

**Live Implementation**

This websocket broadcast system is now live on flydenver.com, providing real-time updates to thousands of users. Its successful deployment on a major government website is a testament to its robustness and efficiency.

**Conclusion**

This project exemplifies the potential of modern cloud technologies to create scalable, cost-effective, and high-performance solutions. If you have a project that requires real-time data broadcasting to a large audience, this websocket system could be the perfect solution.
